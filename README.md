# STella
Decent Story Teller App

_Welcome to the Timeless Tavern where the Yarn of Yesteryear is Spun_

Select your tale, and let the Bard sing you the tale.

The embedded LLM processes the story in real-time, and will dynamically update the Heroes and Events lists on screen.

These allow you to select and talk to the characters from your favourite books!

## Live Demo

*High-spec or GPU based machine advisable for better experience*

*The first time AISSH is run, AISSH will embed a Llama-3.1-8B model in the browser. This is a substantial download so will take a while*

Subsequent runs will use the cached LLM and so load much faster (~10-15 seconds).
