Syntax woke up and looked outside.

It was a sunny day. He liked sunny days.

His dog Woof was asleep.

"Hey Woof", whispered Syntax to Woof - "It's sunny outside. Shall we go on an adventure?"

Woof twitched - still dreaming.

Syntax made a cup of coffee and planed a route across the ridge into the Forest of Wylde.

Syntax then fetched the tennis ball that Woof loved the most. His footsteps woke up Woof.

Woof had seen the tennis ball and barking with excitement, jumped up and down by the door.

Together they open the door and ventured onto the dirt track, leading up the hill towards the ridge, above the Forest of Wylde.
